# Gelman Hill Exercises

Finally getting around to uploading my solutions to the chapter problems from Andrew Gelman and Jennifer Hill's [Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (first ed)](https://smile.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g3905707922?_encoding=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&ie=UTF8). I will try to keep this updated as I have time to work through the book. Feedback is welcome!
